        review: 'Max provides excellent customer service! I had my laptop repaired and back to me within a couple of hours of dropping it off and at a fair price. Wow, wasnt expecting it so quick! He even stayed past business hours to make sure I got it back same-day. I wont go anywhere else. Highly recommend!',
